/// order to satisfy demand in a priority order.  The LookInst makes deployment
/// decisions by running mini-simulations initialized by cloning the current
/// simulation state and running the mini-simulation ahead some lookahead
/// duration.  The TimeSeries table specified by the user is checked to
/// determine any production shortfall compared to the user-specified demand
/// curve.  Deployments are then shifted to lower priority prototypes as
/// necessary in order to reduce shortfall as much as possible.
///
/// Because the LookInst runs many internal simulations, it is slower than
/// running a simulation using similar deployments without the LookInst.  The
/// size of this performance penalty varies depending on simulation details,
/// but a rough rule of thumb is ``10 * lookahead / deploy_period`` as a
/// multiplier on the simulation time when run with static deployments (e.g.
/// using the DeployInst).  If a growth simulation runs in 20 seconds with the
/// DeployInst, then a 24 month lookahead with annual deployments will result
/// in an approximate 400 second simulation run time.  
///
/// Due to limitations of how the LookInst operates, facilities that have
/// intermittent offline periods (e.g. reactors refueling) can cause
/// inefficient or undesired deployment decisions to occur. For example, if
/// reactors have a non-zero refueling period where they are not producing
/// electricity, then if their cycles are not staggered well, then periods with
/// more reactors offline refueling will cause the LookInst to shift many
/// deployments to lower priority prototypes unfruitfully in an attempt to meet
/// demand with little to no effect.  This will result in undesired deployment
/// decisions in addition to a significant performance impact (i.e.  slower
/// simulations).  Ways to avoid this problem include:
///    
/// - making sure online/offline cycles and the deploy period have a large
///   least common multiple for better staggering on average.  For example,
///   make a reactor cycle (including refueling time) be something like 19 if
///   the deploy period is 12 months - if reactors are deployed annually, you
///   get 19 separate deployment periods before reactor cycles start to overlap.
///
/// - eliminate offline periods (with no production of e.g. power) effectively
///   increasing capacity factor to 100% and compensate by reducing production
///   capacity accordingly.  For example, reduce reactor power capacity
///   to 900 MWe from 1000 MWe and reduce refueling time in the 20 month cycle
